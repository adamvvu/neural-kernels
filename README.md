## Data-Adaptive Neural Kernels

**Abstract**
We consider the usage of neural networks to directly learn an optimal kernel
from the data for nonparametric regression. By imposing additional structure
into the model, we show that the estimator becomes a linear smoother and is equivalent 
to learning an optimal smoothing matrix from the data. In experiments, we explore 
settings where kernel methods might excel over neural networks and vice versa.
The proposed neural kernels in this paper share properties of both methods,
and could potentially be useful for nonparametric regression in settings
with smooth functions.
